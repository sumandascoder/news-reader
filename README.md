### BUILT IN A DAY (More of inspiration to build something new than code bravery) - Getting inspired from Bret McGowen's talk at GDG NYC about Cloud Vision API


In most of the nations we still have the printed newspaper and as we know "Old habits die hard", there are millions who still prefer to use print media oven pixels. And out of them at least 20% can't use the print media because with age things get blurry(I mean literally blurry) but they still like to go for the same media. With different constraints like limited time, availability people want to get most out of their time. This small app actually saves ample time for them.
This small app tries to help them get the same text read aloud to them with just a snap of picture. 

It is nothing fancy code except the idea (which is novel). Most of snippets are used from 
[android vision api sample app](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-vision/tree/master/android)

### What does the app do?
- Asks the user to load an image which in turn is processed by the Google Cloud Vision API.
- Once image is processed, let user click the speech button for the text to be read aloud to him/her


### APIs
- Google Cloud Vision API (OCR)
- Text To Speech

### TODO's (Future of the App)
- Have Image backup mechanism, some storage for images so that they can stack and re-listen
- Have Music like controller for the text to speech
